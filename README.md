Task Description
 Your task is to write a Python program to fetch research papers based on a user-specified query. The
 program must identify papers with at least one author affiliated with a pharmaceutical or biotech
 company and return the results as a CSV file.
 Problem Details
 1. Source of Papers
 ‚óã Fetchpapersusing the PubMed API
 ‚óã Theprogramshouldsupport PubMed's full query syntax for flexibility.
 2. Output Requirements
 ‚óã Returntheresults as a CSV file with the following columns:
 ‚ñ† PubmedID:Uniqueidentifier for the paper.
 ‚ñ† Title: Title of the paper.
 ‚ñ† Publication Date: Date the paper was published.
 ‚ñ† Non-academicAuthor(s): Names of authors affiliated with non-academic
 institutions.
 ‚ñ† CompanyAffiliation(s): Names of pharmaceutical/biotech companies.
 ‚ñ† Corresponding Author Email: Email address of the corresponding author.
 3. Command-line Program Features
 ‚óã Acceptthequeryasacommand-line argument.
 ‚óã Providethe following options:
 ‚ñ†-hor--help:Display usage instructions.
 ‚ñ†-dor--debug:Printdebug information during execution.
 ‚ñ†-for--file:Specifythe filename to save the results. If this option is not
 provided, print the output to the console.
 4. CodeOrganization and Environment
 ‚óã VersionControl:
 ‚ñ† UseGitforversion control. The code must be hosted on GitHub.
 ‚óã DependenciesandSetup:
 ‚ñ† UsePoetryfordependency management and packaging.
 ‚ñ† Ensurethatrunning poetry install sets up all dependencies.
 ‚óã Execution:
 ‚ñ† Provideanexecutable command named get-papers-list via Poetry.
 5. Documentation
 ‚óã IncludeaREADME.mdfilewith the following details:
 ‚ñ† Howthecodeisorganized.
‚ñ† Instructions on how to install dependencies and execute the program.
 ‚ñ† Mentionanytools (e.g., LLMs or libraries) used to build the program, along with
 relevant links.
 6. Evaluation Criteria
 ‚óã Functional Requirements:
 ‚ñ† Adherencetotheproblem statement.
 ‚ñ† Ability to fetch and filter results correctly.
 ‚óã Non-functional Requirements:
 ‚ñ† Typedpython: Using types everywhere.
 ‚ñ† Performance: Efficiency of API calls and processing.
 ‚ñ† Readability: Clear and maintainable code with appropriate comments and
 docstrings.
 ‚ñ† Organization: Logical separation of concerns (e.g., modular functions and
 classes).
 ‚ñ† Robustness: Error handling for invalid queries, API failures, or missing data.
 Bonus points
 Each of these additional points
 1. Break the program into two parts: a module and a command line program that uses the module.
 2. Publish the module in test-pypi.
 Notes
 ‚óè YouarefreetouseLLMtools or other resources to assist in development‚Äì please s
 ‚óè Clearly document any external tools used in the README.md.
 ‚óè Assumetheprogramwill be evaluated by automated scripts, so strict adherence to conventions
 is required.
 ‚óè Howtoidentify non-academic authors? You can apply any heuristics (email addresses, words like
 university, labs etc).
